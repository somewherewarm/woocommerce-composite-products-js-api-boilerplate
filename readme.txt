WooCommerce Composite Products JS API boilerplate.

== Description ==

To bootstrap a custom script in order to use the Composite Products API, it is recommended to use the 'wc-composite-initializing' jQuery event, which passes a reference to the WC_CP_Composite object instance associated with the displayed Composite product. Once you have obtained a reference to the WC_CP_Composite object instance, you can start interacting with the app. This plugin is a working example that you can use as a boilerplate for writing plugins on top of the Composite Products JS API.

Requires Composite Products v3.6+.

== Installation ==

1. Install the latest versions of WooCommerce and WooCommerce Composite Products.
2. Upload the plugin to the **/wp-content/plugins/** directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu in WordPress.
